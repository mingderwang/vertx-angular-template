# Vert.x Angular Template

**This is not released yet!!! It's work in progress** I'll announce a release as soon as possible.

The goal of this project is to provide a template project for a modern hipster web application project based on a [Vert.x](https://vertx.io) backend and an [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) frontend. The backend will be built by gradle and the frontend project generated by [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and built by [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com). This requires a tight gradle/grunt integration.

It's just great to stand of the shoulder of giants. And to not re-invent the wheel, this template project is built based on existing working solutions:

- The [Vert.x Gradle template](https://github.com/vert-x/vertx-gradle-template)
- The [JHipster Yeoman generator](https://jhipster.github.io)
- Gradle/Grunt integration

In the future this project might result in a 'VHipster' Yeoman generator.

## Setup

Setting up a template project requires two major steps:

- Install the prequisites on your dev machine
- Install required modules/plugins
- Clone the template project

### Required Native Software

Install these software packages on your dev machine. It's best to use the native software management of your OS.

- Recent Java VM (Java 7 and up) installed and in the path
- Node.js installed and in the path
- Git client


### Modules/Plugins

Install Yeoman

    npm install -g yo


## Resources

Things I found on the net which might help me in successfully realize this project:

- [Jhipster Ember Generator](https://github.com/jarias/generator-jhipster-ember) uses Gradle instead of maven


### Steps

Steps I did:

- Cloned the Vert.x Gradle template as decribed in the [Vert.x docs](http://vertx.io/gradle_dev.html)
